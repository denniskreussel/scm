# Simple Case Management

Simple Case Management (scm) is a tool that helps with incident response processes and alert handling.
The main goal of the project is to get you started with a mixture of best practices and my opinions :) while giving you flexibility.
You should be able to customize alert and case types, custom fields, conditional fields, automatic enrichments anf playbooks to your needs.
